# CHUGGR v2.20 (deployed)
CHUGGR is a social media app that allows friends to connect over sports and beverages from wherever they are in the world. It is light-hearted application that was created during the COVID Pandemic. Originally, it was developed as a tool to augment our fantasy leagues and give our friends a fun user experience that includes realtime chats, user authentication, friends, follows, and betting. Web v2.20 is live and available to join here: https://chuggr.io/

 * Added new UI widgets to pages that feature grids (show only 3 items at a time)
