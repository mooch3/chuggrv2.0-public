# CHUGGR v2.1 (refactored)
CHUGGR is a social media app that allows friends to connect over sports and beverages from wherever they are in the world. It is light-hearted application that was created during the COVID Pandemic. Originally, it was created as a tool to augment our fantasy leagues and give our friends a fun user experience that includes realtime chats, user authentication, friends, follows, and betting. Web v2.1 is live and available to join here: https://chuggr.io/
